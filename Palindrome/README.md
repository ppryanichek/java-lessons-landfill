# Palindrome
Implement a method that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is read equally from left to right and from right to left (including an empty one). When determining the "palindromy" of the line, only letters and numbers should be taken into account. And spaces, punctuation marks, as well as case of characters should be ignored. It is guaranteed that only strings consisting of ASCII characters (numbers, Latin letters, punctuation marks) fall into the method. That is, there will be no Russian, Chinese and other exotic characters in the line.
